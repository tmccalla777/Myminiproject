####How Python Uses Indentation to Control Flow
Tabs are used in Python in order to order the execution of code, where this enhances the usability and usefulness of the 
code being written (as well as organization).

A good example of flow control can be explained with the organization of a nested if-then statement within a for-loop, 
where we can see how the order of when the loops are executed is impacted by indentation.
Say we have the following loop...

for x in range(1,5):

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if x %% 2 == 0:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print("Even Number!")

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;else:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print("Odd Number!")

Here we can see how the tabs are used to order the execution of the loops, where we would like the nested if-then loop 
to run AFTER the for loop.
####Don't Repeat Yourself
The _Don't Repeat Yourself_ concept is used in software development to reduce repetition of code in order to ensure that
code is organized and as efficient as possible. Removing duplicate code will make the code easier to read and much easier
to maintain for future use.
