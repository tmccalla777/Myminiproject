<h2>Step 1: Initialize a New Project</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
  <li>Create a new project/directory from the command line

  $ miniproject</li>
  <li>Go to Github and click the ‘+’ button in the top right corner and select ‘New Repository’.</li>
  <li>
  Then fill out the Repository name and the Description fields(optional). </li>
<li>  Keep it public, and do not “Initialize this repository with a README”. Don’t change anything else.

  Click “Create repository”.</li>

  Next you’ll see the setup page.

</ul

And if you go to your Github Repo page, you’ll see the ReadMe that you initialized with and the reference to the first commit you made.

Now let’s get this Repo up to date.

Go back to your terminal and git add, git commit, and git push:

$ git add .$ git commit -m "Second commit"$ git push

Now check out your repo. It should have all the files you created your local directory with along with a new commit id

You’re initialized and ready to start working!

<h2>Step 2: Setup Your Team</h2>
<p>You’re going to need to add your team to your repo so they can collaborate.

Once your team is added as collaborators they’ll be able to push, merge, and a ton of other things so make sure you’re only adding your teammates.

Click on the “Settings” tab of your rep, then “Collaborators” then search for Github users and add them by clicking “Add Collaborator”:

They’ll receive an email letting them know you added them and will be listed as a collaborator.


If you’re a collaborator, go to the Github Repo page,

Git Clone the project, and cd into the directory.

Don’t fork it!

Forking will copy it in a new Repo to your Github page, but you don’t want that — you want to collaborate on the same Github Repo with your teammates.
</p>

$ git clone git@github.com:MinesJA/github_guide.git$ cd github_miniproject/

<strong>And now you’re ready to collaborate!</strong>


<h2>Step 3: Collaborating</h2>

When you’re using git to work on the same project with multiple people, there’s one central rule you must follow:

<<strong>THE MASTER BRANCH SHOULD ALWAYS BE DEPLOYABLE</strong>

The way to keep Master deployable is to create new branches for new features and merge them into Master when they’re completed.

Here’s how that works.
<strong> Step 3a: Branches </strong>
To start, branches should always represent features. For example, if you want to add the ability for a user to login you should probably create a branch called “user_authentication” and in that branch you should only update what you need to to enable a user to login.

It’s also important when collaborating that your team picks features that don’t have overlapping code. For example, you shouldn’t be working on a “user_login” branch at the same time that your teammate is working on a “user_logout” branch because the chances that you’re working on the same files and are writing overlapping code are very high.

In your terminal create a new branch:

 Adding the “-b” and a name at the end creates a new branch and then moves into that new branch.
